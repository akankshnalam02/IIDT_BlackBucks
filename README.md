Image classification, a fundamental task in computer vision, involves assigning precise labels to
images. It plays an essential role in applications such as facial recognition, medical diagnostics,
and autonomous systems. This project centers on developing a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 low-resolution
images across 10 distinct categories. The goal is to design a CNN capable of achieving high
classification accuracy.
The project emphasizes preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset using techniques like normalization
and data augmentation to optimize its compatibility with CNNs. It focuses on designing an
effective CNN architecture by fine-tuning layers and hyperparameters and rigorously training the
model while evaluating performance through metrics like accuracy and loss. Preliminary results
underscore the potential of the CNN for robust image classification, with opportunities for further
refinement to enhance its effectiveness. This work advances the understanding of CNN design
principles and showcases their practical application in addressing real-world image classification
challenges.
